_Stupid crypto tricks._

WARNING: You should, under no circumstances, use this.

## What is Veil?

Veil is an incredibly experimental hybrid cryptosystem for sending and receiving confidential,
authentic multi-recipient messages which are indistinguishable from random noise by an attacker.
Unlike e.g. GPG messages, Veil messages contain no metadata or format details which are not
encrypted. As a result, a global passive adversary would be unable to gain any information from a
Veil message beyond traffic analysis. Messages can be padded with random bytes to disguise their
true length, and fake recipients can be added to disguise their true number from other recipients.
Further, Veil supports hierarchical key derivation, allowing for domain-specific and disposable
keys.

## Algorithms & Constructions

Veil uses just two distinct primitives:

* [STROBE](https://strobe.sourceforge.io) for confidentiality, authentication, and integrity.
* [ristretto255](https://ristretto.group) for key agreement and signing.

### STROBE Protocols

Veil includes STROBE protocols for the following capabilities:

* `veil.kem`: a `C(1e, 2s, ECC DH)` key encapsulation mechanism over ristretto255
* `veil.pbenc`: memory-hard authenticated encryption using balloon hashing
* `veil.scaldf.*`: functions for deriving ristretto255 scalars from non-uniform or secret values
* `veil.schnorr`: fully deterministic Schnorr signatures over ristretto255
* `veil.stream`: streaming authenticated encryption with key ratcheting

Full details and documentation can be found in the 
[`pkg/veil/internal`](https://github.com/codahale/veil/tree/main/pkg/veil/internal) directory.

### Child Key Derivation

Each participant in Veil has a secret key, which is a 64-byte random string. To derive a private key
from a secret key, the secret key is mapped to a ristretto255 scalar. A delta scalar is derived from
an opaque label value and added to the secret scalar to form a private key. The process is repeated
to derive a private key from another private key. To derive a public key from a public key, the
delta scalar is first multiplied by the curve's base element, then added to the public key element.

This is used iterative to provide hierarchical key derivation. Public keys are created using
hierarchical IDs like `/friends/alice`, in which the private key `/` is used to derive the private
key `friends`, which is in turn used to derive the private key `alice`.

### Multi-Recipient Messages

A Veil message combines all of these primitives to provide multi-recipient messages.

First, the sender generates a random message key and and creates a header block consisting of the
message key and the total length of all encrypted headers plus padding. For each recipient, the
sender encrypts a copy of the header using `veil.kem`. Finally, the sender adds optional random
padding to the end of the encrypted headers.

Second, the sender uses `veil.schnorr` to create a signature of the plaintext with the encrypted
headers (including any padding) as associated data.

Finally, the sender uses `veil.stream` to encrypt the message and the signature using the
message key, again with the encrypted headers as associated data.

To decrypt a message, the recipient iterates through the message, searching for a decryptable
header. When a header is successfully decrypted, the message key is recovered, and the message is
decrypted. The signature is verified against the encrypted headers and the plaintext, assuring
authenticity.

Because Veil's KEM is authenticated, a message recipient can only decrypt the message if they have
the sender's public key. To send an anonymous message, the sender can include the public key with a
message.

### Passphrase-Based Encryption

To safely store secret keys, `veil.pbenc` is used with a 32-byte random salt to encrypt the secret
key. This integrates a memory-hard password hashing algorithm, Balloon Hashing, with authenticated
encryption.

## What's the point

1. Veil uses a minimal number of cryptographic primitives in a clear, declarative fashion.
   ristretto255 uses a safe curve, has non-malleable encodings, and has no co-factor concerns.
   STROBE is built on the Keccak-f\[1600\] permutation, the core of SHA-3, which has seen
   significant scrutiny over the last decade.
2. Veil messages are confidential: no one can read the message without being a recipient.
3. Veil messages can be read by all the intended recipients, but no recipient can modify the
   message's content or metadata without possessing the sender's secret key.
4. Veil messages are tamper-proof. If a single bit of the entire message is changed, all the
   recipients will know.
5. Veil messages are non-repudiable: if the message is decryptable, it is guaranteed to have come
   from the possessor of the sender's secret key.
6. Veil messages are indistinguishable from random noise, revealing no metadata about recipients'
   identities, number of recipients, etc.
7. Veil messages can be padded, obscuring a message's actual length.
8. The number of recipients in a Veil message can be obscured from recipients by adding fake keys
   to the recipients list.
9. Veil messages can be arbitrarily big and both encrypted and decrypted in a single pass.
10. Veil keys can be derived arbitrarily for domain-specific or disposable use.
