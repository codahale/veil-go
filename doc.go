// Package veil provides an implementation of the Veil hybrid cryptosystem.
//
// Veil is an incredibly experimental hybrid cryptosystem for sending and receiving confidential,
// authentic multi-recipient messages which are indistinguishable from random noise by an attacker.
// Unlike e.g. GPG messages, Veil messages contain no metadata or format details which are not
// encrypted. As a result, a global passive adversary would be unable to gain any information from a
// Veil message beyond traffic analysis. Messages can be padded with random bytes to disguise their
// true length, and fake recipients can be added to disguise their true number from other
// recipients.
//
// You should not use this.
